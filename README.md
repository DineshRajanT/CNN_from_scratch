# CNN_from_scratch
This implementation of CNN is built using Numpy


This project is a task regarding the implementation of a CNN classification model from scratch without any frameworks...

Dataset used : https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/

About the project:


* Instead of using frameworks like PyTorch,TensorFlow...a custom CNN model is built from scratch.


* The basic layers like Convolution layer,max_pooling layer are implemented,


* Some of the activation funcations like Softmax,ReLu(Rectified Linear unit),Sigmoid are also present so that thi scode can be modified easily according to the Dataset and the nature of the task.

* Well in our case Sigmoid is used since it is a kind of binary classification task (i.e) either 0 or 1.If there are mutliple classes then, Softmax is preferred.


A CNN_model.ipynb walks through the complete stages of data preprocessing and modeling.
